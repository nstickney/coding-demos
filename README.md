## Background

I've taught a computing survey course, an introductory (Python) programming
course, and a database design course at the university level.
This repo is the oddball collection of programs I've written, generally live,
as demonstrations to generate interest or deepen understanding.

## Usage

Each program captured here has its own instructions and documentation,
generally captured in comments.
